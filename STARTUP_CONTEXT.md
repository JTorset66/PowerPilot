## Current feature notes

- Control keeps only the Maximum, Balanced, and Battery plans.
- The tray app follows Windows power mode: Best performance, Balanced, or Best power efficiency.
- Plan creation refreshes PowerPilot plans from the current non-PowerPilot Windows plan when one is selected.
- CPU information comes from CPUID inline assembly.
- GPU names come from Windows display adapter enumeration plus CPU-based iGPU resolution, without helpers.

## Installer status

- Installer assembly was rebuilt successfully with build-installer.ps1.
- Latest install verification, when available, is tracked in CHAT_MEMORY\LATEST_INSTALL.md.
- This file confirms build and installer assembly status inside the project directory for quick startup reference.

## Where to look first on a new startup

1. README.md
2. STARTUP_CONTEXT.md
3. CHAT_MEMORY\CURRENT_CONTEXT.md
4. CHAT_MEMORY\LATEST_BUILD.md
5. CHAT_MEMORY\LATEST_INSTALL.md
6. CHAT_MEMORY\INDEX.md

## Working habit reminder

- Take regular snapshots or commits.
- Good times to snapshot:
  - before changing power-plan logic
  - before rebuilding the installer
  - before running elevated install or uninstall steps
  - before larger UI or power-plan refactors
